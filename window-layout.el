;;; `wlf:layout' function

;; * Layout recipe:

;; ( (split type) (split option) 
;;                (left window name or recipe)
;;                (right window name or recipe) )

;;   - : split vertically
;;   | : split horizontally

;; split option (the prefix 'left' can be replaced by 'right', 'upper' and 'lower'.)
;;   :left-size  (column or row number) window size
;;   :left-max-size  (column or row number) if window size is larger than this value, the window is shrunken.
;;   :left-size-ratio  (0.0 - 1.0) window size ratio. the size of the other side is the rest.
;; 
;; Note: 
;; The split option can be omitted.
;; The size parameters, :size, :max-size and :size-ratio, are mutually
;; exclusive.  The size of a window is related with one of the other
;; side window. So, if both side windows set size parameters, the
;; window size may not be adjusted as you write.

;; * Window options:

;;   :name  [*] the window name.
;;   :buffer  a buffer name or a buffer object to show the window. If nil or omitted, the current buffer remains.
;;   :default-hide  (t/nil) if t, the window is hided initially. (default: nil)
;;   :fix-size  (t/nil) if t, when the windows are laid out again, the window size is remained. (default: nil)

;; * subwindow-p option:

;; If this option is not nil, this function splits the windows within
;; the current window. If this option is nil or omitted, this function
;; uses the entire space of the current frame. Because some user
;; actions and complicated window layouts may cause unexpected split
;; behaviors, it is easy to use the entire space of a frame.

;; * Return value (Window management object):

;; You should not access the management object directly, because it is not 
;; intended direct access.
;; You can make some management objects to switch the window layout.

;; * Layout hook

;; After splitting windows, registered hook are called with one
;; argument, the window management object.
